# RE-Portfolio

I used this portfolio update as an opportunity to reflect on the incredible amount of progress made in a short amount of time within this coding bootcamp. At the time of the first portfolio, we had only just learned css, and I felt I was making great strides. Fast forward a month and suddenly what I had learned seemed a pebble in the road to becoming an efficient developer. Back end development was something I had never experienced, but delving headfirst into node-based applications and server structures allowed me a glimpse into the depth of the internet and revealed how much I didn't know. This updated portfolio aims to show a fraction of my journey. Though there isn't much back end I can apply to the site, I wanted to show some of the progress I've made in web development as a whole.
